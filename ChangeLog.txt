Changed:
 spawns the G, M, and P in distinct non adjacent tiles
 allows movement of the P character with w a s d, enter to confirm entry. Pulls first ascii value 
 
11/18: scaled up to 64 squares. 8 by 8. good number for computers. Added win lose dialogue cases. 
 
to do: 
algorithm for M movement
possibly a second M or other obstacle generation? 
fix the horizontal line change movement?
	currently 
	y - - - p 
	x - - - -
	- - - - -   
goes to x instead of y. Its close enough that we can argue that it is intentional though. 

if we dont want to add the functionallity to add obstacles, we could create 
static walls and add multiple monster AI pacman style? seems easy enough to do?
